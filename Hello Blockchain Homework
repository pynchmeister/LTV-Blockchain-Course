 // I got 2 errors that were constant for "update message" function. I guess I had to close the constructor function
 with curly bracket before just adding function. The second error, solidity AI suggested I remove helloblockchain 
 from within my constructor input parentheses. I dont know why but I removed it and after running the compiler
 after that, it went through with no error. Overall, I had to rewatch videos and use solidity AI and GPT, so I am 
 mostly following along, not necessarily aware of all the syntax as yet, but I will with practice and more study.
